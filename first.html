    <h1>Hizbollah is crying,What should Israel do?</h1>

    <h4>As the war in Gaza escalates, there are signs of something more dangerous on Israel's northern border. Another proxy militia of Iran located in Lebanon, Hezbollah, has been carrying out rocket and drone attacks on northern Israel since the day after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 last year. Thousands of acres of land were burnt in the attack. 70,000 Israelis who were evacuated have not yet returned home. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also hit back, forcing 90,000 people to flee their homes in southern Lebanon. Israel killed an influential Hezbollah leader on July 3. A direct war could turn into the biggest conflict in the region in decades. </h4>

         <h5>Tree fair-2024 is written on the main gate, but there is only one tree shop among the 39 shops in the fair. On the one hand, the forest department says that they did not organize the fair. On the other hand, the upazila administration says that the fair belongs to the forest department, they are doing it only with overall cooperation. Conscious people cannot accept such an arrangement in the name of tree fair.</h5>
